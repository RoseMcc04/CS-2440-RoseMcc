What is recursion?

- A recursive method is a method that directly or indirectly calls 
  itself.
- Recursion should be considered when a problem can be solved by solving
  a smaller instance of the same problem and then changing it a little. The 
  smaller instance is solved the same way. 
- The small case is called the base case. A recursive algorithm should always
  have a base case. Eventually, the problem has to get small enough to be 
  solved on its own (without recursion). 
- Each recursive call should simplify the problem (get closer to the base case).
