Sequential/Linear Search

- The technique you have to use where the data you are searching through
  is in no particular order. The searches often used in oractice involve
  arrays of ints. We can use comparison operators (==, <=, <, >=, >, !=)
  with ints. If we want to work on an array of objects, we would need to 
  also implement the compareTo() method in the class.

Binary Search 

- If you have a sorted set of baseball cards, you will have a much easier
  time finding a particular card. Binary search is a method that works 
  roughly like this on a set of baseball cards. 

  1. If your unsearched set is empty, declare failure. If there is at least
     one card left in the unsearched portion of your set, see if what you 
     are looking for is the "middle" card. 
  2. If it is, you've found it. 
  3. If it is not, and the middle card comes after the one you are looking 
     for, restrict your search to the left half of the set and go to step 1.
  4. If it is not, and the middle card comes before the one you are looking 
     for, restrict your search to the right half of the step and go to step 1.
