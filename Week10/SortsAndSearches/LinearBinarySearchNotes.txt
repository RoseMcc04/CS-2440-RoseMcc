Sequential/Linear Search

- The technique you have to use where the data you are searching through
  is in no particular order. The searches often used in oractice involve
  arrays of ints. We can use comparison operators (==, <=, <, >=, >, !=)
  with ints. If we want to work on an array of objects, we would need to 
  also implement the compareTo() method in the class.
