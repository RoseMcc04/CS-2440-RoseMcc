    // Introduction

    /*
     * Back in Week 5, we covered the IntArrayBag class. We are using the
     * same specification along with a few newer methods. We will learn how to
     * implement these, along with looking at the algorithmic complexities
     * to observe worst-case scenarios of collections-related methods.

     // Fields

     /*
      * Two instance variables --> head and manyNodes
      * Invariants --> 
      *     - Elements in the bag are stored in a linked list
      *     - Head reference of list is stored in the instance variable head
      *     - Total number of elements is stored in manyNodes
