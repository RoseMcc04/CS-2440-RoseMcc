     * There are eight primitive types in Java.
     * 
     * 1. byte
     * 2. short
     * 3. int
     * 4. long
     * 5. float
     * 6. double
     * 7. char
     * 8. boolean
     * 
     * However, everything else is just an object. All objects are part of a 
     * heirarchy of Java objects and are all subclasses of the Object class. We
     * have previously discussed methods of the Object class that are 
     * inherited by all other classes but often have to be overidden to be
     * useful. (Ex. equals(), toString(), compareTo(), hashCode())
