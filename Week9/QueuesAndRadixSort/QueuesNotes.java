    /*
     * - A queue is a data structure of ordered items such that items can only
     *   be inserted only at one end (called the rear) and removed at the other
     *   end (called the front). Follows the FIFO principle (First-In-Last-Out).
     * - We are in queues today; turn to get food in a cafeteria, line to pay
     *   for groceries, and so forth. 
     * 
     * - Unline with Stack<E>, there is no Queue<E> class in the Java library, 
     *   however, there is a Queue<E> interface implemented by several Java 
     *   classes, LinkedList being among them. An example is listed below...
     *   
     *   Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();
