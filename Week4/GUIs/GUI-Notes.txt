GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces)

- GUIs allow users to interact with a program using graphical
  elements such as windows, buttons, and many other features
- The primary framework used in this course is Swing
- Swing is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC), which 
  is an API (Application Program Interface) for making GUIs
- The package for Swing is javax.swing

Parts of a GUI 

- minimize button --> minimizes the interface size
- expand button --> maximizes the interface size
- close button --> closes out of the GUI
- title bar --> where you put the name of the program
- label --> specific area of the GUI
- button --> object when clicked on allows the user to perform a
             specific 
- spinner --> object that allows the user to click on arrows to
              choose a specific parameter
- frame --> the underlying structure of the interface
- checkbox --> GUI structure that allows the user to check one or 
               multiple options out of a list
- dropdown menu --> allows a dropdown list for the selection of
                    one item for the user 
- radio button --> allows the user to specifically pick one options
                   out of a range of options 

General Steps

1. Declare and allocate a JFrame since it is the window. Then, set 
   the properties.
2. Organize GUI components into categories and allocate a JPanel for
   each category. Decide on a layout manager for each JPanel and use 
   it to add components to the JPanel.
3. Pick a layout manager for the JFrame and add the JPanels to the
   JFrame.
4. Create and add listeners to the components that require them.

JFrame 

- Basic window
- Title bar
- Frame 
- Minimize, Expand, Close buttons 
- JFrame gameFrame = new JFrame();

JPanel

- Container
    - Used to align components on the JFrame 
    - Other items are added to the JPanel 
    - Items will be inserted left to right
- Create 
    - Jpanel buttonPanel = new JPane();
