**Clock.java, CuckooClock.java, and Clock24.java are just used as
Inheritance examples. The main notes will be on here. 

What is Inheritance?

- Inheritance --> a new class derives attributes and behaviors from
                  an existing class
    - The new class is called the subclass
    - The existing class is called the superclass
- Inheritance is used to extend the functionality of the clases

Extended Classes

- Subclass inherits the fields and methods from the superclass
    - We call these inherited methods and fields
- Methods and fields added to subclass will only be accessible to 
that class or its subclasses
