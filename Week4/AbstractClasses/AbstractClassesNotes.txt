Abstract Classes

- Sometimes, you will have a larger software system that has multiple classes with
  minute differences
- We can properly perform this task by creating a superclass and implementing those
  methods in its respective subclasses
- You can force the subclasses to use methods by the superclass by making them abstract, 
  along with the superclass being an abstract class

Interfaces

- Similar to the idea of a completely abstract class
- List of related methods that are specified, but not implemented
- A class can implement an interface by writing the methods

instanceof

- Keyword used on an object at runtime to see if the object implements the interface
- You have to cast the object before calling other methods

Inheritance in UML (Unified Modeling Language)

- To illustrate inheritance in UML diagrams, a subclass is connected to its superclass
  with a line that has an open arrowhead at the point toward the superclass
- To illustrate an abstract class, you put the notation "<<interface>>" and write the
  abstract methods in italics
